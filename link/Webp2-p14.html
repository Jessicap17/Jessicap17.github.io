<p>You make it to the nearest amusement park and make a beeline for your favorite roller coster, the Stomach Twister. The wait is short and before your know it you are soaring throuh the air doing majestic flips and barrel rolls and like always after you get off, you vomit into the nearest trash can. Now with your voice sounding suffieciently ill from all your upchucking you call into work saying you have a bad case of stomach flu. The secritary picksup and after a brief conversation she accepts your excuss and wishes you a fast recovery.</p>
