<p>You sit there in your car waiting for over an hour until the tow truck finally comes. You ask to be dropped off at work and like a nie person the driver and agrees. You are officially and hour and 40 minues late, you think things could not get any worse until you make it to your desk and see your boss waiting there for you, not looking happy.</p>
