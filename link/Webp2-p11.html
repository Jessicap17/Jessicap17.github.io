<p>You tell yourself that pain is just a feeling and you are above feelings, so like all the other emotions you are not emotionally equipted to deal with you push them to the back of your mind as you spit into the sink and finish running your brush through your hair. Then limp back to your room, grabing your glasses before heading out the door. The traffic is suprisingly light this  morning and you silently hope that means today might not be so bad, that is until you get a flat tire.</p>
